Pickering Public Library acknowledges the City of Pickering
resides on land within the Treaty and traditional territory
of the Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation and 
Williams Treaties signatories of the Mississauga and 
Chippewa Nations. Pickering is also home to many Indigenous
 persons and communities who represent other diverse,
distinct, and autonomous Indigenous nations. This acknowledgement
reminds us of our responsibilities to our relationships with
the First Peoples of Canada, and to the ancestral lands on
which we learn, share, work, and live.
